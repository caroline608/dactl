# Codeland 2018


Day 1 of Codeland. So far I've listen to four amazing talks, danced along to bruno mars and Bollywood music, and this! I've created this blog!!

I'm learning Jekyll with Monica Powell. As you can tell its going great.

#### List of things I'd like to get out of Codeland
- Find at least one person with similar interest
- Create a static blog site
- Be inspired by the work being done in the tech community
